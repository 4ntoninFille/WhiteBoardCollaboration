# Collaborative Whiteboard

This project is a collaborative whiteboard tool that allows multiple users to draw together in real-time.

## Why 5G Could be Incredible for the Project

- **Low Latency**: 5G networks provide significantly reduced latency compared to previous generations. This low latency ensures a smooth and responsive drawing experience for users, making the collaborative whiteboard tool feel more natural and real-time.

- **High Bandwidth**: 5G offers high bandwidth capabilities, allowing for the fast and efficient transmission of drawing actions and updates between users. This enables seamless collaboration, even when multiple users are drawing simultaneously or when dealing with complex drawings.

- **Improved Connectivity**: With its advanced network architecture, 5G provides improved connectivity and coverage, ensuring users can access the collaborative whiteboard tool from various locations and devices. This makes it easier for users to connect and collaborate regardless of their physical location.

- **Enhanced Mobile Experience**: As 5G is designed to cater to mobile devices, it enhances the experience of using the collaborative whiteboard tool on smartphones and tablets. Users can enjoy the benefits of real-time collaboration and drawing on the go, opening up new possibilities for creative and collaborative work.
